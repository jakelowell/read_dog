      <p>Lesson Overview</p>
<p>Introduction Granting credit to both retail and corporate customers is the core business of a bank. In doing so, banks need to have adequate systems to decide to whom to grant credit or not. Credit scoring is a key risk assessment technique, which analyzes an obligor’s credit risk. Essentially, credit scoring aims at quantifying the likelihood that an obligor will repay the debt or not. The outcome of the credit scoring exercise is either an accept or reject decision.</p>
<p>Credit scoring is situated at step 1 of the credit risk modeling process for PD modeling: Create the model. In this lesson, you will learn the fundamentals of credit scoring. To start, I’ll give a brief definition of credit scoring. Then we’ll look at the main approaches to credit scoring in both retail and corporate portfolios.</p>
<p>Credit Scoring in Retail Portfolios</p>
<p>Credit Scoring Approaches in Retail Portfolios In this section, we will discuss credit scoring approaches in retail portfolios. Popular examples of retail portfolios are mortgages, revolving exposures such as credit cards or overdraft accounts, and installment loans such as car loans. Three key statistical approaches for credit scoring in retail portfolios are application scoring, behavioral scoring, and dynamic scoring. All three approaches rely on historical data to build scorecards. A scorecard then provides a score whereby a higher score typically indicates lower credit risk and a lower score a more risky obligor. The three approaches differ in the way they construct their historical data and set their prediction horizon. Let’s zoom into these three approaches into more detail. Application Scoring Application scoring is the first important statistical credit scoring approach. The purpose of application scoring is to come up with a credit score, which reflects upon the default risk of a customer at the moment of loan application. This is a very important scoring mechanism, as it will decide whether the credit will be accepted or rejected.</p>
<p>In order to build an application scorecard, one first needs to define the concept of default. Multiple definitions of default can be adopted here. It could be based upon profit, amount owed, negative net present value, or number of months in payment arrears. A popular definition of default in the earlier days of credit scoring was that a customer was considered to be a defaulter if he or she ran into more than three months of payment arrears. With the introduction of the Basel Capital Accords, the default definition has now been set to 90 days in payment arrears, which is similar. Note, however, that, in some countries, this definition has been overruled. In the United States (for example, in retail credit for residential mortgages), the default definition is 180 days. For qualifying revolving exposures, it’s also 180 days, and for other retail exposures, it’s 120 days.</p>
<p>Let’s assume now that we have our definition of default set. The next step is then to identify the information that can be used to predict default. Two different types of information can be distinguished here: application variables and bureau variables.</p>
<p>Let’s first discuss the application variables. This is the information that is provided to the bank by the applicant upon loan application. Popular examples here are date of birth or age, gender, income, marital status, years living at current address, employment status, etc. This information is internally available to the bank. It can be complemented by bureau variables.</p>
<p>Bureau variables are obtained from credit bureaus, which are external to the bank. A credit bureau is an organization that assembles and aggregates credit information from various financial institutions or banks. It can collect both positive or negative credit information, depending upon the country in which it operates. Usually, credit bureaus provide two sources of information. First, they have raw bureau data, like total amounts of credit that a customer has outstanding, whether the customer has already been late with some payments at other financial institutions (yes or no), number of credit checks that have been made for a particular customer at other financial institutions, etc. Using this raw bureau data, credit bureaus can now build bureau credit scores. These bureau credit scores can then be sold to interested counterparties and used into their application scoring models. Credit bureaus are all around these days. In the US, you have very popular bureaus like Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion, which each covers their own geographical region. All three provide a FICO score, which ranges between 300 to 850, with higher scores reflecting better credit quality. These FICO scores are commonly used in the US, not only by banks, but also by insurance providers, Telco firms, utilities companies, etc. Other countries obviously also have their credit bureaus. In Australia, there is Baycorp Advantage. Germany has the Schufa, Netherlands BKR, and Belgium CKP. Dun &amp; Bradstreet is a popular credit bureau targeting the mid-corp and small and medium-sized enterprise market.</p>
<p>Here you can see an example of an application scorecard. As you see, it includes three characteristics: age, gender, and salary. Each of these characteristics has been categorized or coarse-classified into a few categories. For example, age has been categorized into four categories. The first category is age up to 26 years, the second category is from 26-35 years, and so on. Each of those categories has points assigned to it. The more points, the higher the credit quality. We can see that, within the age characteristic, the points are monotonically increasing from 100 to 225. We can also see that men are more risky than women since they receive only 90 points instead of 180. For salary, we again see a monotonic increase. Let’s now imagine that a new customer comes and applies for credit. It’s a female customer. Age is 32 and salary is $1,150. We can now look up the points for each of these three characteristics. For age, the customer gets 120 points; for gender, 180 points; and for salary, 160 points. This all adds up to 460 points, which represents the total credit quality of this particular customer. This now needs to be compared against a cutoff. The cutoff represents the minimum required credit quality set by the bank. We can see that this particular customer falls below the cutoff and will thus be rejected. Imagine now that we consider the same customer, but with a salary of 2500 instead of 1150. Do you think this customer will be accepted or rejected? Well, let’s verify. The new score now becomes 120 + 180 + 240, which equals 540. This is above the cutoff of 500, so the customer will be accepted.</p>
<p>The purpose of application scoring is now to build a scorecard like the one you see right here. Note that this encompasses many decisions that need to be made during the scorecard development process. For example, how do we select the characteristics age, gender, and salary? Why don’t we include other ones like employment status, number of years living at current address, etc.? Why do we categorize age into four categories? How do we decide upon the points assigned to each category? Why do we set the cutoff at 500? If it had been set at 400, the customer would have been accepted. In this course, we will extensively discuss how to answer all these questions within the context of application scorecard development.</p>
<p>When building an application scorecard, you are actually taking two snapshots of customer behavior. The first snapshot is taken at loan origination, where you will gather both the application and credit bureau data. This is the information, which will then be used to predict default. The second snapshot is taken at some later point, during the loan, at which the default behavior will be determined. Ideally, one should wait until the end of the loan to be absolutely certain about whether a customer defaulted or not. However, for mortgages, this would imply one has to wait for 15, 20, or even more years to do this. Obviously, this is not feasible. Empirical analysis has shown that the majority of customers default in the first 18 months. Hence, many firms take the second snapshot 18 months after loan origination to see whether customers defaulted or not. In this way, they will construct a data set on which they will then build an application scorecard.</p>
<p>Application scorecards provide scores. A score is a measure, which allows us to rank customers from high risk (low score) to low risk (high score), and as such, provides a relative measure of credit risk. Scores are unlimited and can be measured within any range; they can even be negative. A score is not the same as a probability. A probability also allows us to rank, but on top of that, since it is limited between 0 and 1, it also gives an absolute interpretation of credit risk. Hence, probabilities provide more information than scores. For application scoring, one does not need well-calibrated probabilities of default. However, for other application areas such as regulatory capital calculation, as we will discuss later, calibrated default probabilities are needed. In later sections, we will discuss how to transform scores to probabilities.</p>
<p>In this section, we have discussed application scoring as a snapshot-to-snapshot problem whereby application and bureau variables are used to predict default within the next 18 months. To see a detailed list of variables that are often used in application scorecard development, click the Information button. Behavioral Scoring Behavioral scoring is another statistical credit scoring approach, whereby we’re going to look at our existing credit customers. Imagine that I would apply for credit at your bank. First, you are going to put me through an application scoring model, and let’s say that you decide to accept me. At some point, you want to reassess my credit risk, taking into account all my recent behavior. That recent information could be my checking account behavior summarized by the average of my checking account balance, the maximum or minimum thereof, or the trend during the previous 12 months. Other interesting information could be delinquency information like if I already incurred payment delays, etc. Also changes in job status or home address could be considered. All this behavioral information can then be combined into a behavioral credit score, which provides us with a new and better assessment of the credit risk of our already existing obligors.</p>
<p>Behavioral scoring models are typically constructed using a 24-month time frame. Twelve months are taken to measure and quantify all the information, which will be used as predictors, and a subsequent 12 months to determine the default status.</p>
<p>Behavioral scoring is dynamic since it summarizes the behavior into various dynamic variables such as average checking account balance, maximum checking account balance, trend in checking account balance, etc. As such, it is as if one constructs a video clip of customer behavior during a period of 12 months. This video clip is then again summarized using a snapshot to determine the Good-Bad status 12 months after the observation point. Hence, behavioral scoring is often referred to as a video-clip-to-snapshot problem.</p>
<p>Behavioral scorecards have different types of usage. First, they can be used for debt provisioning and profit scoring. As such, they will prove to be a very important and valuable input for Basel Capital calculation as we will discuss later. Behavioral scores can also be used to authorize accounts to go in excess of their credit limit. They even allow to set credit limits based upon the corresponding default risk. Upselling means that the credit limit is increased as a result of a good behavioral score. Down-selling means that the credit limit is decreased to mitigate risk as a result of a bad behavioral score. Behavioral scores can also be used to do cross-selling of other products. For example, one might consider selling insurance products to a customer having a good behavioral score on his or her mortgage loan. Behavioral scores might also help to decide on credit renewals. Finally, they can be used for proactive debt collection. For example, in case of a continuously decreasing behavioral score, the bank could opt to set up an arrangement with the customer in order to prevent default from occurring.</p>
<p>When compared to application scoring, behavioral scoring starts from a much bigger data set in terms of the number of variables. Behavioral scoring data sets typically have a few hundred of variables to consider. Hence, during scorecard construction, it will be very important to carefully select the variables that contribute to predicting default risk. In a later section, we will discuss how to appropriately do this using input selection techniques.</p>
<p>Just as with application scoring, the aim of behavioral scoring is to provide a score, which is, as explained earlier for application scores, a relative credit assessment allowing to rank order customers from low risk to high risk in terms of their default likelihood. Dynamic Scoring We already discussed application scoring as a snapshot-to-snapshot problem, behavioral scoring as a video-clip-to-snapshot problem, and in what follows, we will now discuss dynamic scoring as a video-clip-to-video-clip statistical credit scoring approach. In dynamic scoring, a risk assessment is provided for any future moment in time. Contrary to application and behavioral scoring, where the risk assessment was provided 18 and 12 months in the future respectively, in dynamic scoring, risk assessments will be provided for 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 18 months or more in the future. As such, it gives a lot more information than an application or behavioral scorecard. However, it is a lot harder to construct since one needs to use special statistical techniques such as survival analysis, which is not that easy. We do see a growing interest in dynamic credit scoring models in the industry, and some banks already started to experiment with it. The outcome of these models is not only useful for credit risk assessment, but is also interesting to model customer lifetime value, for example.</p>
<p>Text Version Collapse Print Credit Scoring in Corporate Portfolios</p>
<p>Credit Scoring Approaches in Corporate Portfolios In this section, we will discuss four credit scoring approaches for corporate portfolios: the prediction approach, the expert approach, the agency-ratings approach, and the shadow-ratings approach. As opposed to retail portfolios, a key issue in corporate credit risk modeling is the availability of data. The four approaches covered differ in the type of data that they use. Also note that a default in a corporate setting is often called a bankruptcy. Let’s continue and discuss these approaches into more detail. Prediction Approach The prediction approach assumes that there is historical data available about firms and their bankruptcy status. This data can then be analyzed by statistical techniques to predict corporate bankruptcy. Popular data to be used for bankruptcy prediction is accounting information such as balance sheet and financial statement ratios, and stock price behavior if the firm is publicly listed.</p>
<p>A well-known model for bankruptcy prediction is the Altman Z-model for manufacturing firms. It was built in the late 60s using a statistical technique called discriminant analysis. Separate versions exist for public and private industrial companies. Essentially, the z-score is a linear combination of five accounting ratios: Working Capital/Total Assets, Retained Earnings/Total Assets, Earnings before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets, Market or Book Value of Equity/Total Liabilities, and Net Sales/Total Assets. A higher z-score reflects a more healthy firm and thus a lower bankruptcy risk. Extensions of the original z-score model have been provided for privately held and non-manufacturing firms. The z-score can be used by a bank as its internal bankruptcy prediction model. It can also be used to benchmark other bankruptcy prediction models. Expert-Based Approach As discussed previously, the prediction approach necessitates the availability of data, and you may not always have data available in a corporate setting. So in the absence of data, the expert-based approach is also used in corporate credit risk modeling. Basically, the expert-based approach builds a scorecard in a qualitative way using the business experience, intuition, and common sense of one or more credit experts.</p>
<p>Here you can see an example of an expert-based scorecard. You can see that it considers various characteristics, such as industry position, market-share trends and prospects, etc. Each of those characteristics have been defined in a qualitative way. They also have scores assigned to them. These scores have not been estimated from historical data, since this is not available here, but have been estimated by the business experts themselves in a subjective way. Expert-based scorecards are often written down as a set of If-Then business rules. Although they might seem inferior to statistical-based scorecards at first sight, they are still quite commonly used in the industry for specific corporate portfolios where no historical data is available. Agency-Ratings Approach We already discussed the prediction approach, which assumes the availability of historical bankruptcy data, and the expert-based approach, which assumes the availability of expert-based knowledge or experience. The agency-ratings approach is an approach that can be adopted if none of these is available. In other words, if the bank cannot come up with an internal approach to do credit risk assessment, it needs to look externally. Rating agencies are interesting partners to collaborate with in this case since they provide credit ratings for almost any type of corporate exposure. These ratings typically vary from AAA, which represents excellent credit quality, to AA, A, and up to D, which represents the default status. The ratings also come with default rates measured across different time horizons such as one, two, three, or even five years. Banks can then purchase these credit ratings to score their corporate exposures. Popular rating agencies are Moody’s, Standard &amp; Poor’s, and Fitch. Shadow-Ratings Approach The shadow-ratings approach starts from a set of ratings for a particular set of corporate obligors. In a next step, information will be collected for each corporate, which might have an influence on the rating. Example data, which can be considered here, are accounting ratios, firm characteristics, stock price behavior, etc. The aim is then to use all this information as predictors in a statistical regression model to predict the ratings. The advantage of this approach is that one obtains a white-box understandable model, which clearly indicates how the various characteristics of an obligor contribute to the rating. Hence, it will also allow to give clear advice to corporates on how to improve their rating. Furthermore, in the long term, this approach allows the bank to become independent from the rating agency, since the internal statistical model can now be used to rate any obligor given its characteristics. The shadow-ratings approach aims at building a statistical model mimicking the external ratings provided by a rating agency. Rating Agencies As already said, the most popular rating agencies are Moody’s Investor Service, Standard &amp; Poor’s, and Fitch. They provide ratings to almost any type of debt or fixed-income securities. Examples are ratings for companies (both private and public), countries and governments (sovereign ratings), local authorities, and banks. Retail exposures are typically not covered by the rating agencies. The methodology behind the rating assignment is obviously not disclosed, but it is based upon a combination of both quantitative and qualitative modeling.
