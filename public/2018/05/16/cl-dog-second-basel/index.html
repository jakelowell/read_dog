      <p>Introduction In this lesson, we will zoom into the Basel I, Basel II, and Basel III Capital Accords. These are regulatory guidelines, which have been introduced for financial institutions in order to appropriately determine their provisions and capital buffers to protect them against various risks they are exposed to. One important type of risk is obviously credit risk, and in this lesson we will extensively discuss the impact of these accords on the development of PD, LGD, and EAD credit risk models. The Basel Capital standards provide guidelines for preparing the data, creating the scorecard model and the definition of the ratings and calibration of a credit risk model. Let’s get into more detail.</p>
<p>Objectives</p>
<p>In this lesson, you learn to do the following: • define regulatory and economic capital • describe the characteristics of the Basel I, Basel II, and Basel III Capital Accords • identify the differences between the standardized and internal ratings-based (IRB) approaches to credit risk modeling • explain the Basel IRB model architecture • explain the Basel Capital requirements model • describe the adoption of the Basel Capital Accords in Europe, the US, and the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China)</p>
<p>Text Version Collapse Print Fundamentals of the Basel Capital Accords</p>
<p>Regulatory and Economic Capital Let’s start by first introducing the concepts of regulatory and economic capital. Banks get cash inflow from various sources. A first important source are the savings depositors who buy savings products from the bank. Examples are savings accounts, term accounts, pension funds, etc. In return, they receive a fixed or variable interest payment. Another source are the shareholders or investors. They buy shares, which gives them an ownership relationship with the bank. If the firm makes profit, then part of it can be paid to the shareholders as dividends. Both savings money and shareholder capital are essential elements of a bank’s liabilities. On the asset side, a bank will use the money obtained by making various investments. A first investment, and part of a key banking activity, is lending. Banks will lend money to obligors such that they can buy a house, a car, go traveling or studying. Other investments could be buying various market securities such as bonds, stocks, options, etc.</p>
<p>Note that these investments always have a risk associated with them. Obligors could default and not pay back the loan, and markets can collapse, hereby decreasing the value of securities. Given the societal impact of banks in any economic system, they need to be well-protected against the risks they are exposed to. Bank insolvency or failure should be avoided at all times, and the risks, which banks take on their asset side, should be compensated by appropriate liabilities to safeguard their savings depositors. These people should be guaranteed to always get their savings money back, whenever they want it. Hence, a bank should foresee enough shareholder capital as a buffer against losses. In fact, we could further zoom out and also include retained earnings and reserves, and look at equity as the capital buffer instead. In other words, a well-capitalized bank has a sufficient amount of equity to protect itself against its various risks. So, there should be a direct relationship between risk and equity.</p>
<p>Usually, this relationship is quantified in two steps. First, the amount of risk on the asset side is quantified into a specific risk number. This number is then plugged into some kind of formula, which precisely calculates the corresponding equity, and thus, capital buffer required. There are two views on defining both this risk number and the formula to be used.</p>
<p>The first view is a regulatory view, whereby regulations such as Basel I, Basel II, and Basel III have been introduced to precisely define how to calculate the risk number and what formula to use. Regulatory capital is then the amount of capital a bank should have according to a regulation. However, if there would be no regulation available, banks would be aware of the fact that they need equity capital to protect them. In this case, they would use their own risk-modeling methodologies to come up with a risk number and use their own formula to calculate the buffer capital. This leads us to the concept of economic capital, which is the amount of capital a bank has, based on internal modeling strategy and policy. The actual capital is then the amount of capital a bank actually holds.</p>
<p>Note that various types of capital exist, depending upon their loss-absorbing capacity. Tier 1 capital typically consists of common stock, preferred stock, and retained earnings. Tier 2 capital is of somewhat less quality, and is made up of subordinated loans, revaluation reserves, undisclosed reserves, and general provisions. The Basel II Capital Accord also included Tier 3 capital, which consisted out of short-term subordinated debt, but, as we will discuss later, this has been abandoned in the more recent Basel III Capital Accord. Basel I and Basel II Capital Accords, Part 1 The Basel Accords have been put forward by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. This committee was founded in 1974 by the board of governors of the G10 central banks. Nowadays, it counts 27 members. They meet approximately every three months at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, Switzerland.</p>
<p>The first capital accord introduced was the Basel I Capital Accord, already in 1988. As already mentioned, the aim was to set up minimum regulatory capital requirements in order to ensure that banks are able, at all times, to return depositor’s funds. The Basel I Accord predominantly focused on credit risk and introduced the idea of the capital or Cook ratio, which is the ratio of the available buffer capital and the risk-weighted assets. It put a lower limit on this ratio of 8%. In other words, the capital should be bigger than 8% of the risk-weighted assets. The capital could consist of both Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital as discussed earlier.</p>
<p>In terms of credit risk, the Basel I Capital Accord introduced fixed risk weights depending upon the exposure class. For cash exposures, the risk weight was 0%; for mortgages, 50%; and for other commercial exposures, 100%. As an example, consider a mortgage of $100. Applying the risk weight of 50%, the risk-weighted assets then become $50. This is the risk number we referred to earlier. We will now transform this into buffer capital using the formula: capital is 8% of the risk weighted assets. This gives us a buffer capital of $4. So, to summarize, our $100 mortgage should be financed by least $4 of equity to cover potential credit losses.</p>
<p>Although it was definitely a good step towards better risk management, the Basel I Accord faced some important drawbacks. First, the solvency of the debtor was not properly taken into account, since the risk weights only depended upon the exposure class and not upon the obligor or product characteristics. There was no sufficient recognition of collateral guarantees to mitigate credit risk. It also offered various opportunities for regulatory arbitrage by making optimal use of loopholes in the regulation to minimize capital. Finally, it only considered credit risk, but no operational or market risk. Basel I and Basel II Capital Accords, Part 2 To address the shortcomings of the Basel I Capital Accord, the Basel II Capital Accord was introduced. It consisted of three key pillars. Pillar 1 covers the minimal capital requirement; pillar 2, the supervisory review process; and pillar 3, market discipline and disclosure.</p>
<p>Under pillar 1, three different types of risk were included. Credit risk is the risk faced when lending money to obligors. Operational risk is defined as the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. Popular examples here are fraud, damage to physical assets, and system failures. Market risk is the risk due to adverse market movements faced by a bank’s market positions via cash or derivative products. Popular examples here are equity risk, currency risk, commodity risk, and interest-rate risk. In this lesson, we will continue by addressing credit risk. The Basel II Capital Accord foresees three ways to model credit risk: the standard approach, the foundation internal ratings-based approach, and the advanced internal ratings-based approach. All boil down to building quantitative models for measuring credit risk.</p>
<p>All quantitative models built under pillar 1 will need to be reviewed by overseeing supervisors. This is discussed in pillar 2. Here key activities to be undertaken are the introduction of sound processes to evaluate risk such as the internal capital adequacy assessment process, ICAAP, and the supervisory monitoring.</p>
<p>Finally, once all quantitative risk models have been approved, they can be disclosed to the market. This is covered by pillar 3. Here a bank will typically semiannually disclose its risk profile, and provide qualitative and quantitative information about its risk-management processes and strategies to the market. The objective here is to inform the investors and convince them that the bank has a sound and solid risk-management strategy, which hopefully will result into a favorable rating for the bank, such that the bank can attract funds at cheap rates. Basel III Capital Accord Because of the 2008 credit crisis, the Basel III Capital Accord was introduced. It builds further upon the Basel II Accord, but tries to further strengthen global capital standards. Its key attention points are a bigger focus on tangible equity capital since this is the component with the greatest loss-absorbing capacity. It reduced the reliance on models developed internally by the bank and ratings obtained from external rating agencies. It also put a greater focus on stress testing.</p>
<p>For systematically important banks, it stresses the need to have a loss-absorbing capacity beyond common standards. It puts a greater focus on Tier 1 capital, consisting of shares and retained earnings, by abolishing the Tier 3 capital introduced in Basel II, as it was deemed of insufficient quality to absorb losses. A key novelty is that it introduced a risk-insensitive leverage ratio as a backstop to address model risk. It also includes some facilities to deal with procyclicality, whereby, due to a too cyclical nature of capital, economic downturns are further amplified. The Basel III Accord also introduced a liquidity coverage and net-stable funding ratio to satisfy liquidity requirements. We will not discuss those further as we will focus on credit risk instead. The new Basel III standards took effect on January 1, 2013, and for the most part, will become fully effective by January 2019. Compared to the Basel II guidelines, the Basel III Accord has no major impact on the credit risk models themselves. It does however introduce additional capital buffers as we will discuss in what follows.</p>
<p>The Tier 1 capital ratio was 4% of the risk-weighted assets in the Basel II Capital Accord. It was increased to 6% in Basel III to be implemented by 2015. The common Tier 1 capital ratio, whereby common Tier 1 consists of common equity, which is common stock and retained earnings, but no preferred stock, was 2% of the risk-weighted assets in Basel II and 4.5 % of the risk-weighted assets in Basel III, again to be implemented by 2015. A new capital conservation buffer is introduced, which is set to 2.5% of the risk-weighted assets to be covered by common equity by 2019. Also, a countercyclical capital buffer is added ranging between 0 to 2.5% of the risk-weighted assets to be implemented by 2019.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, a non-risk-based leverage ratio is introduced, which should be at least 3% of the assets and covered by Tier 1 capital. Very important to note here is that we look at the assets and not risk-weighted assets as with the previous ratios. The assets also include off-balance-sheet exposures and derivatives. The idea here is to add this ratio as a supplementary safety on top of the risk-based ratios.</p>
<p>In Basel II, the total capital ratio is the sum of the Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 capital ratio. In Basel III, the capital ratio then becomes the sum of the Tier 1 capital ratios, the capital conservation buffer, the countercyclical capital buffer, and, if relevant, an additional capital ratio for systematically important banks.</p>
<p>Text Version Collapse Print Modeling Credit Risk in a Basel Setting</p>
<p>Basel Approaches to Credit Risk Modeling In what follows, we will discuss how credit risk can be modeled according to the Basel II and III Capital Accords. Basically, there are three approaches available, as already discussed: the standardized approach, the foundation internal ratings-based approach, and the advanced internal ratings-based approach. The approaches differ in terms of their sophistication and level of flexibility that is allowed to use internally estimated risk numbers. Standardized Approach to Credit Risk Modeling Let’s first discuss the standardized approach. For non-retail exposures, this approach relies on external credit assessment institutions, or ECAIs, to provide credit ratings. Popular examples of ECAIs are Moody’s, Standard &amp; Poor’s, and Fitch. Given the crucial impact of these ECAIs, the Accord has introduced eligibility criteria such as objectivity, independence, transparency, and disclosure, which need to be fulfilled in order to be officially recognized as an ECAI. The ratings provided by the ECAIs will then be mapped to risk weights provided in the Accord. Risk weights are provided for sovereigns, banks, corporates, and other exposures. The capital itself is then calculated using the formula: capital = 8% of the risk-weighted assets.</p>
<p>Here you can see the risk weights for various exposure classes. For retail, the risk weight is 75% for non-mortgage exposures and 35% for mortgage exposures. Remember, in Basel I, the risk weight for mortgages was 50%, which is higher. For corporates, the risk weights vary between 20% for AAA-rated exposures to 150% for B or lower-rated exposures. For sovereigns, the risk weights vary between 0% for AAA-rated countries to 150% for B or lower-rated countries. For loans already in default, the risk weight can go up to 150%. Note that the European Banking Authority, EBA, has introduced mapping schemes to transform an ECAI’s credit ratings to credit quality steps, which can then be further mapped to risk weights using the European capital directive. Let’s illustrate this with an example.</p>
<p>Assume we have a corporate exposure of $1 million. It’s unsecured with a maturity of five years and Standard &amp; Poor’s assigns a AA rating to it. Using the European directive, a AA rating corresponds to a credit quality step of 1, which, according to Article 122, will map to a risk weight of 20%. The risk-weighted assets thus become 20% out of $1 million or $0.2 million. The capital can then be calculated as 8% thereof, or thus, $0.016 million. The standardized approach also provides facilities for credit-risk mitigation in case of collateralized loans.</p>
<p>Although the standardized approach looks simple and appealing at first sight, it suffers from inconsistencies between ratings of different ECAIs with the accompanying danger of cherry-picking the ECAIs. It also has problems in terms of coverage of various types of exposures. For example, retail exposures are only discriminated in terms of mortgage or non-mortgage. A more detailed categorization is highly desirable here. Ideally, every obligor should have his or her own risk profile, whereby not only default risk is considered, but also loss and exposure risk as measured by LGD and EAD. Internal Ratings-Based Approach to Credit Risk Modeling The internal ratings-based or IRB approach is a more sophisticated approach for quantifying credit risk. It relies on four key risk parameters, which we will introduce first. The PD is the probability of default of an obligor over a one-year period. It is expressed as a decimal and ranges between 0 and 100%. The EAD is the exposure at default and is the amount outstanding. It is measured in currency terms. The LGD is the loss given default, or the ratio of the loss on an exposure due to default of an obligor to the amount outstanding, or thus EAD. It is also expressed as a decimal and ranges between 0 and 100%. The maturity then represents the loan duration. The PD, LGD, and EAD parameters can now be used to calculate the expected loss. The latter is the product of PD times LGD times EAD. Suppose the EAD is $10,000 and the LGD equals 20%. This means that, upon default, 20% out of 10,000 will be lost, or thus $2000. The probability of losing this amount equals the probability of default or 1%, let’s say. The expected loss then becomes $20. In other words, the expected loss, EL, is the product of PD times LGD times EAD. Given these risk parameters, let’s now further zoom into the internal ratings-based approach.</p>
<p>Basically, there are two sub approaches of the IRB approach: the foundation IRB approach and the advanced IRB approach. In the foundation IRB approach, the PD is estimated internally by the bank. The LGD and EAD are either prescribed in the Accord or provided by the local regulator. In the advanced IRB approach, all three risk parameters (PD, LGD, and EAD) can be estimated internally by the bank itself.</p>
<p>Let’s now further elaborate on the IRB approach. A distinction is made between the following types of exposure classes: corporate, retail, central governments (sovereigns) and central banks, institutions, equity exposures, securitization positions, and other non-credit-obligation assets. The foundation IRB approach is typically not allowed for retail exposures. Hence, for retail exposures, you can either choose the standardized or advanced IRB approach. Once the PD, LGD, and EAD are known, risk weight functions provided in the Accord or directive can be used to calculate capital. To allow for a smooth transition, local regulators may allow for a transition period of three years to move from a legacy to a Basel-compliant credit-risk model environment.</p>
<p>Let’s discuss some further default rating specifics. For corporates, central governments, and central banks, the default rating should exclusively reflect the risk of obligor default. At least seven ratings should be available for the non-defaulted obligors and one rating for the defaulters. For retail exposures, a credit rating needs to reflect both obligor and transaction risk. Hence, also credit product characteristics and collateralization need to be taken into account. An excessive concentration of obligors in a rating should be avoided. Instead, ratings should be as homogeneous as possible in terms of default risk. No minimum number of ratings for retail exposures is suggested.</p>
<p>For corporates, central governments, central banks, and retail exposures, a PD needs to be provided per rating. Note that depending upon geographical location, ratings may also be referred to as pools, segments, grades, classes, or clusters. A defaulter is defined as an obligor who is unlikely to pay his or her obligations or is past due more than 90 days. In the US, depending upon the exposure class, this has been set to either 120 or 180 days. In the UK, both 90 and 180 days are used. A lower bound has been set to the PD of three basis points. For obligors in default, it is obvious that the PD equals 100%. To calculate the PD, at least five years of historical data should be used, although not all data should receive equal weight in case older data is less relevant. The PD of a particular rating can then be estimated as the long-run average of the one-year default rates. Basel IRB Model Architecture Right now, we have discussed various measures to quantify credit risk. Think of application scores, behavioral scores, credit ratings, and PDs. The question now becomes: how do these measures relate to one another? Well, let’s discuss how a typical Basel IRB model architecture looks like. Let’s pick a particular portfolio (say, retail mortgages). This portfolio will consist of both recent and older customers. Recent customers are customers that have entered the portfolio during the previous one year. Older customers are the complement thereof and have thus been in the portfolio for more than one year. For recent customers, the best risk assessment available is the application score. For older customers, you can use a much more up-to-date behavioral score instead. Both application and behavioral scores provide a ranking of customers in terms of default risk. Remember, however, that Basel needs more than a ranking. In fact, it requires credit ratings and probabilities of default, which are numbers between 0 and 1 representing the relative likelihood of an obligor to go into default.</p>
<p>So, how can we get credit ratings and PDs? Well, we can get both by coarse-classifying or categorizing the application and behavioral score range. Here you can see an example where the score range has been categorized into above 600, which corresponds to rating A, between 580 to 600, which corresponds to rating B, and so on. Various procedures to define ratings based upon application or behavioral scores can be used for this. A popular approach here is to map onto an agency rating scale, although other approaches such as expert-based approaches are also available as we will discuss in a later lesson. Note that, as a reference, a bank usually has about 15 ratings, although this depends upon the type of exposure. Obviously, the number of ratings and corresponding PDs will have an impact on the regulatory capital.</p>
<p>Once the ratings have been defined, the PDs need to be calculated. Remember, the PD needs to be calculated using at least five years of historical data. It is based on first inspecting the one-year default rates per rating. As an example, the one-year default rate for rating AA is calculated as the ratio of the number of obligors with rating AA at the beginning of the given time period that defaulted during the time period and the number of obligors with rating AA at the beginning of the given time period. Note that the numerator can also measure the number of default events, which will be higher than the number of defaulted obligors if they can default and recover multiple times in the same period. Once the default rates have been obtained, the question becomes how we will extrapolate the future one-year PD. This is also referred to as calibrating the PD. It will be based upon these historical one-year default rates, but also upon our expectations about the future. Popular calibration procedures for PD are the average, maximum, or minimum historical default rate observed, or a particular percentile of the default rate distribution. A sophisticated procedure is to link the default rates to macroeconomic drivers such as GDP, inflation, or unemployment, and build dynamic models based upon time series analysis techniques such as ARIMA.</p>
<p>Here you can see an example of a one-year default rate curve, let’s say for rating single B. If you think the future is not looking bright with a possible downturn, then you can calibrate the PD according the red scenario. However, if you anticipate an economic upturn, then you can calibrate the PD according to the green scenario. The yellow scenario then represents an average between both.</p>
<p>To summarize, here you can see a high-level overview of our Basel IRB model architecture as we worked it out thus far. It has three levels. Level 0 is the data. This includes internally collected data, external data obtained from credit bureaus, for example, and qualitative expert-based data. All this data needs to be prepared first, before models can be built. Level 1 is the credit-scoring level. Here you can find the application and behavioral scorecards that provide a good ordering or discrimination of obligors in terms of their default risk. These scores are then used at level 2 to define credit ratings and do PD calibration. This credit risk model architecture will serve as a blueprint for our discussion on PD, LGD, and EAD model development. We will also use it when talking about model validation such as backtesting and benchmarking, and for stress testing. Basel Capital Requirements Model Assume now that we have our PD, LGD, and EAD estimates available. Remember, when calculating regulatory capital, we also need a formula to combine PD, LGD, and EAD, so as to calculate the capital itself. Here you can see the formula that is being used in the Basel Accord. Note that N stands for the cumulative standard normal distribution and N-1 for its inverse. The question is, of course, where does this formula come from? We will discuss this in what follows.</p>
<p>We will start by explaining the Merton model, which constitutes the basis on which the Basel Capital requirement formulas have been derived. The Merton model was developed in 1974 and studied corporate bankruptcies. It started from a simplified setting. Assume a firm issues a zero-coupon bond with a maturity of one year. Whether the firm will default or not will depend upon whether it has sufficient asset values at the maturity of the debt. In other words, if the asset values exceed the debt level, the firm will be able to pay it back successfully. If the asset values drop below the debt level, then the firm will go into default. This gives us the very basic insight that the asset values determine whether a firm will default or not.</p>
<p>Together with this comes the insight that if you have two firms whose asset values are correlated, then so will be their default behavior. The higher the asset correlation, the higher the probability of common default. Let’s now build further upon this and introduce a few assumptions. First, let’s assume that the number of obligors n is very high and goes to infinity. Next, the exposure size is equal to 1/n for all obligors. In other words, there are no exposure concentrations. We will also assume that all obligors have the same probability of default. This makes sense when the Merton model is applied at the level of a credit rating, since each credit rating has its own PD. We also assume equal pairwise asset correlation ρ between any two obligors. Vasicek now formulated the model as follows: the assets of firm i are equal to the square root of ρ times a factor f, which is an economic factor common to all companies, plus the square root of 1−ρ times an idiosyncratic shock εi, which represents the company-specific risk.</p>
<p>Let’s now assume that both f and εi are mutually independent, standard, normally distributed variables. Hence, the assets of firm i also follow a standard normal distribution. It can be easily shown that the correlation between the asset values of firm i and j works out to ρ and is thus independent of the firm. The unconditional probability of default, PDi, is then the probability that the asset values of firm i are less than or equal to the debt level Di. Since the asset values follow a standard normal distribution, this can be calculated by using the cumulative standard normal distribution evaluated at Di, here written down as N(Di).</p>
<p>The conditional probability of default, given the systematic factor f, PDi|f, is equal to the probability that (Ai is less than or equal to Di|f). This works out as the probability of (the square root of 1−ρ times εi being less than or equal to Di minus the square root of ρ times f, given f). This is equal to the probability of (εi being less than or equal to the ratio of Di minus the square root of ρ times f, and the square root of 1−ρ). Because εi follows a standard normal distribution, the conditional probability of default, given the systematic factor f, can be calculated by evaluating the cumulative standard normal distribution at (Di minus the square root of ρ times f divided by the square root of 1−ρ).</p>
<p>From our earlier unconditional probability, we have Di equal to the inverse cumulative standard normal distribution evaluated at PDi. We also put the systematic factor f, representing the state of the economy to its 99.9% worst level, which is equal to the inverse cumulative standard normal distribution evaluated at 0.001, the latter being equal to minus the inverse cumulative standard normal distribution evaluated at 0.999. This gives us the conditional probability of default equal to the cumulative standard normal distribution evaluated for the sum of the inverse cumulative standard normal distribution evaluated at PDi and the square root of ρ times the inverse cumulative standard normal distribution evaluated at 0.999 divided by the square root of 1−ρ. We can also refer to this conditional probability as α<em>. Now what does this α</em> represent? Actually, you can interpret it as the 99.9% worst-case default rate based upon the average PD and the asset correlation ρ. So, you can think of it as a conservative PD estimate.</p>
<p>When you look at the loss distribution as depicted here, the α* is thus situated far right in the tail. Note that this is also often referred to as a value-at-risk or VAR calculation.</p>
<p>The Basel Accord will now use this α* to calculate its capital. Remember, α* is the loss such that the probability of observing a lower or equal than loss is 99.9%, meaning that there is a 0.1% chance, or once in 1000 years, that an institution’s capital would fail to absorb the loss and become insolvent. The total loss is further decomposed into the expected loss, which is the PD, and the unexpected loss, which is the difference between α* and the PD. The expected loss should be covered by provisions. Provisions are part of the profit-and-loss statement, which are set aside for expected losses. The Basel Capital Accord then focuses on the unexpected loss, which is the difference between α* and the PD. This brings us to the Basel Capital requirements formula. Risk Weight Functions for Retail Here you can see the Basel Capital requirements formula depicted for retail exposures. The formula boils down to α*−PD, which represents the unexpected loss, remember, multiplied by the severity of the loss or LGD. By multiplying the obtained number K with the exposure at default, the regulatory capital is obtained. One critical number in this formula is the asset correlation. Remember, the Merton model was introduced in a corporate setting, where it is rather easy to calculate the asset correlation. However, for retail portfolios, this is less straightforward. That’s why the asset correlation factors have been written down in the accord. For residential mortgages, the asset correlation has been set to 0.15, for qualifying revolving exposures to 0.04, and for other retail exposures, it depends on the PD as you can see depicted. The higher the PD, the lower the asset correlation.</p>
<p>A similar formula has been introduced for corporates, sovereigns, and central bank exposures, as you can see right here. Note that it also includes a maturity adjustment term and a b factor, which have both been set based upon empirical analysis. Here also, the asset correlation ρ depends upon the PD. The maturity M represents the nominal or effective maturity and is between one and five years. For exposures to large financial sector entities, ρ is multiplied by 1.25. Also, a firm size adjustment for small and medium-sized enterprises has been included based upon the total annual sales in millions of euros.</p>
<p>US regulators have introduced the same correlation values for retail and qualifying revolving exposures. However, for other retail exposures, wholesale exposures, and high volatility commercial real estate exposures, other values are recommended as you can see here.</p>
<p>It is important to stress again that the risk-weight functions cover unexpected loss, since expected loss should be covered by provisions. Also remark that the risk-weighted assets are not explicitly calculated. They can however be backed out using the relationship regulatory capital equals 8% of the risk-weighted assets. So this implies that the risk-weighted assets are equal to 12.50 times the regulatory capital. Also, as a result of various quantitative impact studies run by the Basel group, an additional scaling factor of 1.06 is applied to the risk-weighted assets. See Articles 153 and 154 of the EU directive for more details.</p>
<p>Remember the crucial role of the asset correlation term in the capital requirements formula. The question is how were these values determined. For corporates, the assets can be unambiguously quantified by inspecting balance sheets, and various financial models have been introduced to quantify asset correlations in this context. For retail exposures, it becomes a lot more difficult since the assets are not tangible. The asset correlations have been determined using some empirical, but not published, procedure. They reflect a combination of supervisory judgment and empirical evidence. It is assumed that they were set based upon reverse engineering of economic capital models from a selection of large banks worldwide. Note that, as you can see in the Vasicek model, the asset correlations also measure how the asset class is dependent upon the state of the economy. Basel Capital Requirements: Example Let’s now play a bit with the capital requirement formulas in a retail setting. Assume we have a credit-card portfolio with the following characteristics: PD equals 0.03, LGD equals 0.5, and EAD equals $10,000. Remember, credit cards are qualifying, revolving exposures for which the asset correlation equals 0.04. By inputting these values into the capital requirements formula, we get a capital of $343.70. Let’s now gauge the impact of model errors. Assuming a 10% overestimate on the PD, the capital becomes $367.30. Assuming a 10% overestimate on the LGD, the capital becomes $378.00. Finally, assuming a 10% overestimate on the EAD, the capital becomes $378.00. Note that the impact of the PD error is less pronounced than the impact of the LGD and EAD errors. Actually, the impact of the LGD and EAD errors is similar. This could have been anticipated since the capital requirements formula is linear in LGD and EAD. It is, however, nonlinear in terms of PD.</p>
<p>Let’s now also plot the capital requirement formulas. Here you can see the capital for residential mortgages, qualifying revolving exposures, and other retail exposures, for an LGD of 50%, EAD of $1, and varying PD as depicted on the X axis. Note that all curves go up and finally end in 0 for a PD equal to 1. Why is the capital equal to 0 if the PD is 1? Well, it’s because if the PD is 1, there is no more unexpected loss, only expected loss, which needs to be covered by provisions. Worldwide Adoption of the Basel Accords Let’s conclude this chapter by saying a few words about the worldwide adoption of the Basel Accords. It is expected that, by 2015, about 95 nations will implement Basel II/III in some form. The European Union implemented the Accord via the EU Capital Requirements Directives. European banks adopted it in 2008 in parallel with existing systems, and since 2009, use it exclusively. The US implemented Basel II on January 1, 2009. The focus here was on the largest and internationally most active banks. The core banks were required to implement the advanced IRB approach for credit risk. Core banks are defined as banks whereby the consolidated assets exceed $250 billion and who have a consolidated total on-balance sheet foreign exposure exceeding $10 billion. Other US banks are allowed to voluntarily “opt in” to the advanced IRB approach, if they meet the qualification requirements.</p>
<p>The BRIC countries also started to adopt the Basel guidelines. The Brazilian Central Bank allows the standardized approach to be applied uniformly across all financial institutions operating in Brazil. Larger and internationally active institutions are stimulated to first use the foundation IRB approach, followed by the advanced IRB approach. The implementation deadline was set at 2013.</p>
<p>In Russia, the Central Bank of Russia initially focused on the implementation of the standardized approach. The Reserve Bank of India started to allow the implementation of the standardized approach in 2009. Both IRB approaches can be implemented starting from 2014. Note also that additional capital buffers have been introduced.</p>
<p>Finally, in China, the China Banking Regulatory Commission, CBRC, allowed the six top banks in China to start applying Basel II in 2012. Large internationally active banks were required to adopt IRB by 2013 at the latest. Other banks can choose between Basel II implementation or follow a revised version of the existing capital requirements. Chinese banks are also required to carry out quarterly compliance assessments. Programming the Basel Capital Requirement Formula In this demonstration, we will illustrate how the Basel capital requirement formula can be programmed in SAS.</p>
<p>We start by creating a macro, which implements the capital requirement formula. A macro starts by %MACRO followed by its name and ends by %MEND followed by its name. The macro can take input parameters. In our demonstration, the input parameters are the PD, LGD, EAD, and the correlation. To facilitate the editing of the formula, we broke it up in different parts whereby we use the temp1 and temp2 variables to store intermediate results. According to the SAS programming language, macro variables can be referred to using the ampersand symbol. We use this CDF statement to implement the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution. This macro then implements the formula as discussed in the course material and will compute the Basel capital requirements for a given PD, LGD, EAD, and correlation value. Let’s now run it and illustrate how it can be used.</p>
<p>First, we create a residential mortgage data set called resmortgage. We implement a loop from 1 to 999 whereby the PD is varied between 0.001 and 0.999. We then call the macro with the particular PD, an LGD equal to 50%, EAD of 1 dollar, and a correlation of 0.15. Remember, this is the correlation, which is written down in the Basel Accord for residential mortgages. We then output the result of the macro to the data set. Let’s now run this statement and have a quick look at the data set constructed. The data set resmortgage is stored in the work library. As you will see, this data set contains the temp1 and temp2 variables created in the macro. Let’s now plot the capital requirements in terms of PD. This can be done using PROC GPLOT as you see right here. The graph first goes up and then goes back down to zero. Remember for a PD equal to 1 , the unexpected loss becomes zero and the expected loss becomes equal to the LGD times EAD.</p>
<p>We can now do a similar analysis for qualifying revolving exposures. The exercise is basically the same, except the correlation factor needs to be set to 0.04 instead of 0.15 as you see right here. Let’s now run this and also create the plot. You now see a similar plot as in the case of the residential mortgage data set with the capital initially going up and then back to zero.</p>
