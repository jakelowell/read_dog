      <description>Introduction In this lesson, we will discuss modeling loss given default or LGD. Remember, LGD is a very important risk parameter, since it has a linear impact on the capital requirements. To facilitate the discussion of LGD modeling, we will adopt the same multilevel architecture as we used for PD modeling. At Level 0, we will first review the data preparation. This will be followed by a discussion of how to create an LGD model at Level 1.</description>

      <description>In this lesson, we will zoom into stress testing. Stress testing is an activity, which is done once the PD, LGD and EAD models have been built. Its purpose is to analyze how credit risk models behave under adverse internal or external circumstances. We will discuss various ways of doing stress testing, such as sensitivity-based stress testing, historical and hypothetical scenario-based stress testing, and Pillar 1 versus Pillar 2 stress testing.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this lesson, you learn what exposure at default, or EAD, modeling is, the Basel requirements for EAD, and the various methods for building EAD models. Remember, just as with LGD, also EAD has a linear impact on both the expected loss and the Basel Capital. It is thus of key importance to model EAD as accurately as possible.
We will discuss EAD modeling using the same model architecture we used for both PD and LGD.</description>

      <description>1.1 Developments in Credit Risk Management RE Since the beginning of the 1990s, Credit Suisse First Boston (“CSFB”) has been developing and deploying new risk management methods. In 1993, Credit Suisse Group launched, in parallel, a major project aimed at modernising its credit risk management and, using CSFB’s expertise, at developing a more forward looking management tool. In December 1996, Credit Suisse Group introduced CREDITRISK+ - a Credit Risk Management Framework.</description>

      <description>Introduction Variable selection is an important activity during model creation. The idea of variable selection is to carefully choose those variables that are needed to make a default risk classification. Credit scoring data sets typically contain many variables. Especially, behavioral scoring data sets can easily contain a few hundred variables. However, not all variables will turn out to be relevant to the scorecard.
In this lesson, we will outline a step-by-step approach to do variable selection.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this lesson, we focus on developing a credit scoring model in a PD context. We hereby assume that the data has been prepared and is now ready to be analyzed using a classification model. We will discuss how to develop classification models for both retail as well as corporate portfolios.
The aim of classification is to discriminate between the good and bad obligors in terms of default behavior. In this lesson, we start by giving a clear explanation of the classification problem.</description>

      <description>Lesson 3: Preparing the Data for Credit Scoring • Lesson Overview
Introduction Data is the key ingredient to any analytical credit risk model, be it a PD, LGD, or EAD model. So, it is of critical importance that you prepare the data properly. Worth mentioning here is the garbage-in-garbage-out (GIGO) principle, which essentially states that messy data will yield messy analytical models. Hence, it is of utmost importance that every data preparation step is carefully justified, carried out, validated, and documented before proceeding with further analysis.</description>

      <description>Introduction After you have created a classification model, you want to know how well the model performs in predicting the default risk of new observations. New observations are observations or customers that were not used to develop the model. In other words, they were not used to estimate the parameters or train the model.
Measuring the performance of an application scorecard, behavioral scorecard, or corporate credit scoring model is by no means a trivial exercise.</description>

      <description>Lesson Overview
Introduction Now that we have created our application and behavioral credit scoring models, we can continue to Level 2 of our credit risk model architecture by defining the default ratings and calibrating the PD. This is the final step in the PD modeling process. It is, however, an essential step, since the PDs will directly be input into the Basel Capital requirements formula to calculate the necessary buffer capital.</description>

      <description>Introduction Let’s now assume that our PD, LGD, and EAD models have been built. The next step is then to put them into production and start monitoring or validating them. In this lesson, we will discuss various ways of validating credit risk models. In what follows, you will first gain insight into the regulatory aspects of validation, as well as learning key terms and principles. Next, you will learn about the characteristics of quantitative and qualitative validation.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this lesson, we will zoom into the Basel I, Basel II, and Basel III Capital Accords. These are regulatory guidelines, which have been introduced for financial institutions in order to appropriately determine their provisions and capital buffers to protect them against various risks they are exposed to. One important type of risk is obviously credit risk, and in this lesson we will extensively discuss the impact of these accords on the development of PD, LGD, and EAD credit risk models.</description>

      <description>Lesson Overview
Introduction Granting credit to both retail and corporate customers is the core business of a bank. In doing so, banks need to have adequate systems to decide to whom to grant credit or not. Credit scoring is a key risk assessment technique, which analyzes an obligor’s credit risk. Essentially, credit scoring aims at quantifying the likelihood that an obligor will repay the debt or not. The outcome of the credit scoring exercise is either an accept or reject decision.</description>

      <description>Risk Management Examination Manual for Credit Card Activities Chapter VII VII. UNDERWRITING AND LOAN APPROVAL PROCESS Underwriting is the process by which the lender decides whether an applicant is creditworthy and should receive a loan. An effective underwriting and loan approval process is a key predecessor to favorable portfolio quality, and a main task of the function is to avoid as many undue risks as possible. When credit card loans are underwritten with sensible, well-defined credit principals, sound credit quality is much more likely to prevail.</description>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>
