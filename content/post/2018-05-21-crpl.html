<p>1.1 Developments in Credit Risk Management RE Since the beginning of the 1990s, Credit Suisse First Boston (“CSFB”) has been developing and deploying new risk management methods. In 1993, Credit Suisse Group launched, in parallel, a major project aimed at modernising its credit risk management and, using CSFB’s expertise, at developing a more forward looking management tool. In December 1996, Credit Suisse Group introduced CREDITRISK+ - a Credit Risk Management Framework. Current areas of development in credit risk management include: modelling credit risk on a portfolio basis; credit risk provisioning; active portfolio management; credit derivatives; and sophisticated approaches to capital allocation that more closely reflect economic risk than the existing regulatory capital regime. CREDITRISK+ addresses all of these areas and the relationships between them. CREDITRISK+ can be applied to credit exposures arising from all types of products including corporate and retail loans, derivatives, and traded bonds. 1.2 Components of CREDITRISK+ The components of CREDITRISK+ and the interrelationships between them are shown in the following diagram. Figure 1: Components of CREDITRISK+ CREDITRISK+ comprises three main components–a CREDITRISK+ Model that uses a portfolio approach, a methodology for calculating economic capital for credit risk, and several applications of the technology. Introduction to CREDITRISK+ 1 CREDITRISK+ Credit Risk Measurement Credit Default Loss Distribution Scenario Analysis Provisioning Limits Portfolio Management Economic Capital Applications Exposures Default Rates CREDITRISK+ Model Recovery Rates Default Rate Volatilities A modern approach to credit risk management should address all aspects of credit risk, from quantitative modelling to the development of practical techniques for its management. In addition to well-established credit risk management techniques, such as individual obligor (borrower, counterparty or issuer) limits and concentration limits, CREDITRISK+ reflects the requirements of a modern approach to managing credit risk and comprises three main components: • The CREDITRISK+ Model that uses a portfolio approach and analytical techniques applied widely in the insurance industry. • A methodology for calculating economic capital for credit risk. • Applications of the credit risk modelling methodology including: (i) a methodology for establishing provisions on an anticipatory basis, and (ii) a means of measuring diversification and concentration to assist in portfolio management. 1.3 The CREDITRISK+ Model CREDITRISK+ is based on a portfolio approach to modelling credit default risk that takes into account information relating to size and maturity of an exposure and the credit quality and systematic risk of an obligor. The CREDITRISK+ Model is a statistical model of credit default risk that makes no assumptions about the causes of default. This approach is similar to that taken in market risk management, where no attempt is made to model the causes of market price movements. The CREDITRISK+ Model considers default rates as continuous random variables and incorporates the volatility of default rates in order to capture the uncertainty in the level of default rates. Often, background factors, such as the state of the economy, may cause the incidence of defaults to be correlated, even though there is no causal link between them. The effects of these background factors are incorporated into the CREDITRISK+ Model through the use of default rate volatilities and sector analysis rather than using default correlations as explicit inputs into the model. Mathematical techniques applied widely in the insurance industry are used to model the sudden event of an obligor default. This approach contrasts with the mathematical techniques typically used in finance. In financial modelling one is usually concerned with modelling continuous price changes rather than sudden events. Applying insurance modelling techniques, the analytic CREDITRISK+ Model captures the essential characteristics of credit default events and allows explicit calculation of a full loss CREDITRISK + 5 The CREDITRISK+ Model is supplemented by scenario analysis in order to identify the financial impact of low probability but nevertheless plausible events that may not be captured by a statistically based model. 1.5 Applications of CREDITRISK+ CREDITRISK+ includes several applications of the credit risk modelling methodology, including a forward-looking provisioning methodology and quantitative portfolio management techniques. 1.6 Example Spreadsheet Implementation In order to assist the reader of this document, a spreadsheet-based implementation that illustrates the range of possible outputs of the CREDITRISK+ Model can be downloaded from the Internet (<a href="http://www.csfb.com" class="uri">http://www.csfb.com</a>). 1 Introduction Model Credit 2.1 Risk Modelling Concepts 2.1.1 Types of Uncertainty Arising in the Modelling Process A statistically based model can describe many business processes. However, any model is only a representation of the real world. In the modelling process, there are three types of uncertainty that must be assessed: process risk, parameter uncertainty and model error. Process Risk Process risk arises because the actual observed results are subject to random fluctuations even where the model describing the loss process and the parameters used by the model are appropriate. Process risk is usually addressed by expressing the model results to an appropriately high level of confidence. Parameter Uncertainty Parameter uncertainty arises from the difficulties in obtaining estimates of the parameters used in the model. The only information that can be obtained about the underlying process is obtained by observing the results that it has generated in the past. It is possible to assess the impact of parameter uncertainty by performing sensitivity analysis on the parameter inputs. Model Error Model error arises because the proposed model does not correctly reflect the actual process - alternative models could produce different results. Model error is usually the least tractable of the three types of uncertainty. 2.1.2 Addressing Modelling Issues As all of these types of uncertainty enter into the modelling process, it is important to be aware of them and to consider how they can be addressed when developing a credit risk model. Indeed, a realistic assessment of the potential effects of these errors should be made before any decisions are made based on the outputs of the model. 6 CREDIT FIRST SUISSE BOSTON Modelling Credit Risk 2 CREDITRISK + 7 Modelling Credit Risk The CREDITRISK+ Model makes no assumptions about the causes of default. This approach is similar to that taken in market risk management, where no assumptions are made about the causes of market price movements. All portfolios of exposures exhibit credit default risk, as the default of an obligor results in a loss. CREDITRISK+ addresses these types of uncertainty in several ways: • No assumptions are made about the causes of default. This approach is similar to that taken in market risk management, where no assumptions are made about the causes of market price movements. This not only reduces the potential model error but also leads to the development of an analytically tractable model. • The data requirements for the CREDITRISK+ Model have been kept as low as possible, which minimises the error from parameter uncertainty. In the credit environment, empirical data is sparse and difficult to obtain. Even then, the data can be subject to large fluctuations year on year. • Concerns about parameter uncertainty are addressed using scenario analysis, in which the effects of stress testing each of the input parameters are quantified. For example, increasing default rates or default rate volatilities can be used to simulate downturns in the economy. 2.2 Types of Credit Risk There are two main types of credit risk: • Credit spread risk: Credit spread risk is exhibited by portfolios for which the credit spread is traded and marked-to-market. Changes in observed credit spreads impact the value of these portfolios. • Credit default risk: All portfolios of exposures exhibit credit default risk, as the default of an obligor results in a loss. 2.2.1 Credit Spread Risk Credit spread is the excess return demanded by the market for assuming a certain credit exposure. Credit spread risk is the risk of financial loss owing to changes in the level of credit spreads used in the mark-tomarket of a product. Credit spread risk fits more naturally within a market risk management framework. In order to manage credit spread risk, a firm’s value-at-risk model should take account of value changes caused by the volatility of credit spreads. Since the distribution of credit spreads may not be normal, a standard variance-covariance approach to measuring credit spread risk may be inappropriate. However, the historical simulation approach, which does not make any assumptions about the underlying distribution, used in combination with other techniques, provides a suitable alternative. Credit spread risk is only exhibited when a mark-to-market accounting policy is applied, such as for portfolios of bonds and credit derivatives. In practice, some types of products, such as corporate or retail loans, are typically accounted for on an accruals basis. A mark-to-market accounting policy would have to be applied to these products in order to recognise the credit spread risk. 2.2.2 Credit Default Risk Credit default risk is the risk that an obligor is unable to meet its financial obligations. In the event of a default of an obligor, a firm generally incurs a loss equal to the amount owed by the obligor less a recovery amount which the firm recovers as a result of foreclosure, liquidation or restructuring of the defaulted obligor. All portfolios of exposures exhibit credit default risk, as the default of an obligor results in a loss. 2 Credit default risk is typically associated with exposures that are more likely to be held to maturity, such as corporate and retail loans and exposures arising from derivative portfolios. Bond markets are generally more liquid than loan markets and therefore bond positions can be adjusted over a shorter time frame. However, where the intention is to maintain a bond portfolio over a longer time frame, even though the individual constituents of the portfolio may change, it is equally important to measure the default risk that is taken by holding the portfolio. CREDITRISK+ focuses on modelling and managing credit default risk. 2.3 Default Rate Behaviour Equity and bond prices are forward-looking in nature and are formed by investors’ views of the financial prospects of a particular obligor. Hence, they incorporate both the credit quality and the potential credit quality changes of that obligor. Therefore, the default rate of a particular obligor, inferred from market prices, will vary on a continuous scale and hence can be viewed as a continuous random variable. In modelling credit risk, one is concerned with determining the possible future outcomes over the chosen time horizon. The process for the default rate can be represented in two different ways: • Continuous variable: When treated as a continuous variable, the possible default rate over a given time horizon is described by a distribution, which can be specified by a default rate and a volatility of the default rate. The data requirements for modelling credit default risk are analogous to the data requirements for pricing stock options - a forward stock price and the stock price volatility are used to define the forward stock price distribution. The following figure illustrates the path that a default rate may take over time and the distribution that it could have over that time. • Discrete variable: By treating the default rate as a discrete variable, a simplification of the continuous process described above is made. A convenient way of making default rates discrete is by assigning credit ratings to obligors and mapping default rates to credit ratings. Using this approach, additional information is required in order to model the possible future outcomes of the default rate. This can be achieved via a rating transition matrix that specifies the probability of keeping the same credit rating, and hence the same value for the default rate, and the probabilities of moving to different credit ratings and hence to different values for the default rate. This is illustrated in the followi The discrete approach with rating migrations and the continuous approach with a default rate volatility are different representations of the behaviour of default rates. Both approaches achieve the desired end result of producing a distribution for the default rate. The above two representations of default rate behaviour are summarised in the following table: Treatment of default rate Data requirements Continuous variable • Default rates • Volatility of default rates Discrete variable • Credit ratings • Rating transition matrix The CREDITRISK+ Model is a statistical model of credit default risk that models default rates as continuous random variables and incorporates the volatility of the default rate in order to capture the uncertainty in the level of the default rate. A mapping from credit ratings to a set of default rates provides a convenient approach to setting the level of the default rate. 2.4 Modelling Approach 2.4.1 Risk Measures When managing credit risk, there are several measures of risk that are of interest, including the following: • Distribution of loss: The risk manager is interested in obtaining distributions of loss that may arise from the current portfolio. The risk manager needs to answer questions such as “What is the size of loss for a given confidence level?”. • Identifying extreme outcomes: The risk manager is also concerned with identifying extreme or catastrophic outcomes. These outcomes are usually difficult to model statistically but can be addressed through the use of scenario analysis and concentration limits. Table 1: Representations of the default rate process CREDITRISK + 9 Modelling Credit Risk Figure 3: Default rate as a discrete random variable 2 Possible path of default rate B AAA AA BBB BB A Default Frequency of default rate outcomes Default rate Time horizon The CREDITRISK+ Model treats default rates as continuous random variables and incorporates default rate volatility to capture the uncertainty in the level of the default rate. 2.4.2 A Portfolio Approach to Managing Credit Risk Credit risk can be managed through diversification because the number of individual risks in a portfolio of exposures is usually large. Currently, the primary technique for controlling credit risk is the use of limit systems, including individual obligor limits to control the size of exposure, tenor limits to control the maximum maturity of exposures to obligors, rating exposure limits to control the amount of exposure to obligors of certain credit ratings, and concentration limits to control concentrations within countries and industry sectors. The portfolio risk of a particular exposure is determined by four factors: (i) the size of the exposure, (ii) the maturity of the exposure, (iii) the probability of default of the obligor, and (iv) the systematic or concentration risk of the obligor. Credit limits aim to control risk arising from each of these factors individually. The general effect of this approach, when applied in a well-structured and consistent manner, is to create reasonably welldiversified portfolios. However, these limits do not provide a measure of the diversification and concentration of a portfolio. In order to manage effectively a portfolio of exposures, a means of measuring diversification and concentration has to be developed. An approach that incorporates size, maturity, credit quality and systematic risk into a single portfolio measure is required. CREDITRISK+ takes such an approach. 2.4.3 Modelling Techniques Used in the CREDITRISK+ Model The economic risk of a portfolio of credit exposures is analogous to the economic risk of a portfolio of insurance exposures. In both cases, losses can be suffered from a portfolio containing a large number of individual risks, each with a low probability of occurring. The risk manager is concerned with assessing the frequency of the unexpected events as well as the severity of the losses. In order to keep model error to a minimum, no assumptions are made about the causes of default. Mathematical techniques applied widely in the insurance industry are used to model the sudden event of an obligor default. In modelling credit default losses one is concerned with sudden events rather than continuous changes. The essential characteristics of credit default events are captured by applying these insurance modelling techniques. This has the additional benefit that it leads to a credit risk model that is analytically tractable and hence not subject to the problems of precision that can arise when using a simulation-based approach. The analytic CREDITRISK+ Model allows rapid and explicit calculation of a full loss distribution for a portfolio of credit exposures. 2.5 Time Horizon for Credit Risk Modelling A key decision that has to be made when modelling credit risk is the choice of time horizon. Generally, the time horizon chosen should not be shorter than the time frame over which risk-mitigating actions can be taken. CREDITRISK+ does not prescribe any one particular time horizon but suggests two possible time horizons that can provide management information relevant for credit risk management: • A constant time horizon, such as one year. • A hold-to-maturity or run-off time horizon. 10 CREDIT FIRST SUISSE BOSTON CREDITRISK+ is based on a portfolio approach - summarising information about size, maturity, credit quality and systematic risk into a single measure. CREDITRISK + 11 2.5.1 Constant Time Horizon A constant time horizon is relevant, as it allows all exposures to be considered at the same future date. For various reasons, one year is often taken as a suitable time horizon: credit risk mitigating actions can normally be executed within one year, new capital can be raised to replenish capital eroded by actual credit losses during the period, and, furthermore, one year matches the normal accounting period. Given these factors, CREDITRISK+ suggests a time horizon of one year for credit risk economic capital. 2.5.2 Hold-to-Maturity Time Horizon Alternatively, a hold-to-maturity time horizon allows the full term structure of default rates over the lifetime of the exposures to be recognised. This view of the portfolio enables the risk manager to compare exposures of different maturity and credit quality and is an appropriate tool, in addition to the constant time horizon, for portfolio management. The role that the CREDITRISK+ Model plays in active portfolio management is discussed later in this document. A benchmark time horizon of one year can be used for portfolios where there is an intention to maintain exposures for longer than the term of the booked transactions (e.g. traded bond portfolios). 2.6 Data Inputs to Credit Risk Modelling 2.6.1 Data Inputs Any modelling of credit risk is dependent on certain data requirements being met. The quality of this data will directly affect the accuracy of the measurement of credit risk and therefore any decision to be made using the results should be made only having fully assessed the potential error from uncertainties in the data used. The inputs used by the CREDITRISK+ Model are: • Credit exposures • Obligor default rates • Obligor default rate volatilities and • Recovery rates. The CREDITRISK+ Model presented in this document does not prescribe the use of any one particular data set over another. One of the key limitations in modelling credit risk is the lack of comprehensive default data. Where a firm has its own information that is judged to be relevant to its portfolio, this can be used as the input into the model. Alternatively, conservative assumptions can be used while default data quality is being improved. 2.6.2 Credit Exposures The exposures arising from separate transactions with an obligor should be aggregated according to the legal corporate structure and taking into account any rights of set-off. The CREDITRISK+ Model is capable of handling all types of instruments that give rise to credit exposure, including bonds, loans, commitments, financial letters of credit and derivative exposures. For some of these transaction types, it is necessary to make an assumption about the level of exposure in the event of a default: for example, a financial letter of credit will usually be drawn down prior to default and th Figure 4: Rated corporate defaults by number of issuers One-year default rates show significant fluctuations from year to year. 12 CREDIT FIRST SUISSE BOSTON Credit Risk Measurement Exposures Default Rates CREDITRISK+ Model Recovery Rates Default Rate Volatilities Table 2: One-year default rates (%) 2.6.3 Default Rates A default rate, which represents the likelihood of a default event occurring, should be assigned to each obligor. This can be achieved in a number of ways, including: • Observed credit spreads from traded instruments can be used to provide market-assessed probabilities of default. • Alternatively, obligor credit ratings, together with a mapping of default rates to credit ratings, provide a convenient way of assigning probabilities of default to obligors. The rating agencies publish historic default statistics by rating category for the population of obligors that they have rated.

This opinion focuses on the obligor’s capacity and willingness to meet its financial commitments as they fall due. An assessment of the nature of a particular obligation, including its seniority in bankruptcy or liquidation, should be performed when considering the recovery rate for an obligor. It should be noted that one-year default rates show significant variation year on year, as can be seen in the following figure. During periods of economic recession, the number of defaults can be many times the level observed at other times.

As shown previously, actual observed default rates vary from these averages. The amount of variation in default rates about these averages can be described by the volatility (standard deviation) of default rates. As can be seen in the following table, the standard deviation of default rates can be significant compared to actual default rates, reflecting the high fluctuations observed during economic cycles.

Recovery rates should take account of the seniority of the obligation and any collateral or security held. Recovery rates are subject to significant variation. For example, the figure below shows the price distribution of defaulted bank loans and illustrates that there is a large degree of dispersion.

Seniority and security Average Standard deviation Senior secured bank loans 71.18 21.09 Senior secured public debt 63.45 26.21 Senior unsecured public debt 47.54 26.29 Senior subordinated public debt 38.28 24.74 Subordinated public debt 28.29 20.09 Junior subordinated public debt 14.66 8.67 Source: Historical Default Rates of Corporate Bond Issuers, 1920-1996 (January 1997) Moody’s Investors Service Global Credit Research Publicly available recovery rate data indicates that there can be significant variation in the level of loss, given the default of an obligor. Therefore, a careful assessment of recovery rate assumptions is required. Given this uncertainty, stress testing should be performed on the recovery rates in order to calculate the potential loss distributions under different scenarios. 2.7 Correlation and Incorporating the Effects of Background Factors Default correlation impacts the variability of default losses from a portfolio of credit exposures. The CREDITRISK+ Model incorporates the effects of default correlations by using default rate volatilities and sector analysis. 2.7.1 The Random Nature of Defaults and the Appearance of Correlation Credit defaults occur as a sequence of events in such a way that it is not possible to forecast the exact time of occurrence of any one default or the exact total number of defaults. Often, there are background factors that may cause the incidence of default events to be correlated, even though there is no causal link between them. For example, if there is an unusually large number of defaults in one particular month, this might be due to the economy being in recession, which has increased the rates of default above their average level. In this economic situation, it is quite likely that the number of defaults in the following month will also be high. Conversely, if there are fewer defaults than on average in one month, because the economy is growing, it is also likely that there will be fewer defaults than on average in the following month. The defaults are correlated but there is no causal link between them - the correlation effect observed is due to a background factor, the state of the economy, which changes the rates of default. 2.7.2 Impact of the Economy on Default Rates There is general agreement that the state of the economy in a country has a direct impact on observed default rates. A recent report by Standard and Poor’s stated that “A healthy economy in 1996 contributed to a significant decline in the total number of corporate defaults. Compared to 1995, defaults were reduced by one-half….”1 Another report by Moody’s Investors Service stated that “The sources of [default rate volatility] are many, but macroeconomic trends are certainly the most influential factors”.2 As the above quotations indicate and as can be seen in Figure 4 above, there is significant variation in the number of defaults from year to year. Furthermore, for each year, different industry sectors will be affected to different degrees by the state of the economy. The magnitude of the impact will be dependent on how sensitive an obligor’s earnings are to various economic factors, such as the growth rate of the economy and the level of interest rates. 14 CREDIT FIRST SUISSE BOSTON Table 4: Recovery rates by seniority and security (%) Often, there are background factors that may cause the incidence of defaults to be correlated, even though there is no causal link between them. 1 Standard and Poor’s Ratings Performance 1996, February 1997 2 Moody’s Investors Service, Corporate Bond Defaults and Default Rates, January 1996 CREDITRISK + 15 Economic models that attempt to capture the effect of changes in the economy on default rates can be developed in order to specify the default rates for subsequent use in a credit risk model. However, this approach can have several weaknesses, including the following: • Since there are limited publicly available default rate statistics by country or by industry sector, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of an economic model used to derive default rates. • Even if a causal relationship could be established relating default rates to certain economic variables, it is questionable whether such relationships would be stable over several years. Therefore, alternative approaches that attempt to capture the observed variability of default rates have to be sought. 2.7.3 Incorporating the Effects of Background Factors It is possible to incorporate the effects of background factors into the specification of default rates by allowing the default rate itself to have a probability distribution. This is accomplished by incorporating default rate volatilities into the model. The CREDITRISK+ Model models the effects of background factors by using default rate volatilities that result in increased defaults rather than by using default correlations as a direct input. Both approaches, the use of default rate volatilities and default correlations, give rise to loss distributions with fat tails. Section 3 of this document describes in detail how the CREDITRISK+ Model uses default rate volatilities in the modelling of credit default risk. The CREDITRISK+ Model does not attempt to model correlations explicitly but captures the same concentration effects through the use of default rate volatilities and sector analysis3 . There are various reasons why this approach has been taken, including the following: • Instability of default correlations: Generally, correlations calculated from financial data show a high degree of instability. In addition, a calculated correlation can be very dependent on the underlying time period of the data. A similar instability problem may arise with default rate volatilities: however, it is much easier to perform scenario analysis on default rate volatilities, owing to the analytically tractable nature of a model that uses volatilities rather than correlations. • Lack of empirical data: There is little empirical data on default correlations. Defaults themselves are infrequent events and so there is insufficient data on multiple defaults with which to calculate explicit default correlations. Since default correlations are difficult to calculate directly, some approaches use asset price correlations to derive default correlations, but this can only be considered a proxy. This technique relies upon additional assumptions about the relationship between asset prices and probabilities of default. Furthermore, it is questionable how stable any relationship, that may be inferred or observed during a period of normal trading, would be in the event of default of a particular obligor. In addition, where there is no asset price for the obligor, for example in a retail portfolio, there is no obvious way of deriving default correlations. 2 Modelling Credit Risk The CREDITRISK+ Model captures concentration risk through the use of default rate volatilities and sector analysis. 3 Sector analysis is discussed in Sections 2.8 and 3.4 2.8 Measuring Concentration The above discussion has highlighted the fact that there are background factors that affect the level of default rates. The state of the economy of each different country will vary over time and, within each country, different industry sectors will be affected to differing degrees. A portfolio of exposures can have concentrations in particular countries or industry sectors. Therefore, it is important to be able to capture the effect of concentration risk in a credit risk model. The CREDITRISK+ Model described in this document allows concentration risk to be captured using sector analysis. An exposure can be broken down into an obligor-specific element, which is independent of all other exposures, and non-specific or systematic elements that are sensitive to particular driving factors, such as countries or industry sectors. 16 CREDIT FIRST SUISSE BOSTON C M CREDITRISK + 17 CREDIT Model The CREDITRISK+ Model 3 Credit Risk Measurement Exposures Default Rates CREDITRISK+ Model Recovery Rates Default Rate Volatilities 3.1 Stages in the Modelling Process The modelling of credit risk is a two stage process, as shown in the following diagram: By calculating the distribution of default events, the risk manager is able to assess whether the overall credit quality of the portfolio is either improving or deteriorating. The distribution of losses allows the risk manager to assess the financial impact of the potential losses as well as measuring the amount of diversification and concentration within the portfolio. 3.2 Frequency of Default Events 3.2.1 The Default Process The CREDITRISK+ Model makes no assumption about the causes of default - credit defaults occur as a sequence of events in such a way that it is neither possible to forecast the exact time of occurrence of any one default nor the exact total number of defaults. There is exposure to default losses from a large number of obligors and the probability of default by any particular obligor is small. This situation is well represented by the Poisson distribution. What is the FREQUENCY of defaults? What is the SEVERITY of the losses ? Stage 1 Stage 2 Distribution of default losses We consider first the distribution of the number of default events in a time period, such as one year, within a portfolio of obligors having a range of different annual probabilities of default. The annual probability of default of each obligor can be conveniently determined by its credit rating and a mapping between default rates and credit ratings. If we do not incorporate the volatility of the default rate, the distribution of the number of default events will be closely approximated by the Poisson distribution. This is regardless of the individual default rate for a particular obligor. However, default rates are not constant over time and, as we have seen in the previous section, exhibit a high degree of variation. Hence, default rate variability needs to be incorporated into the model. 3.2.2 Distribution of the Number of Default Events The CREDITRISK+ Model models the underlying default rates by specifying a default rate and a default rate volatility. This aims to take account of the variation in default rates in a pragmatic manner, without introducing significant model error. The effect of using default rate volatilities can be clearly seen in the following figure, which shows the distribution of the number of default events generated by the CREDITRISK+ Model when default rate volatility is varied. Although the expected number of default events is the same, the distribution becomes significantly skewed to the right when default rate volatility is increased. This represents a significantly increased risk of an extreme number of default events. 3.3 Moving from Default Events to Default Losses 3.3.1 Distribution of Default Losses Given the number of default events, we now consider the distribution of losses in the portfolio. The distribution of losses differs from the distribution of default events because the amount lost in a given default depends on the exposure to the individual obligors. Unlike the variation of default probability between obligors, which does not influence the distribution of the total number of defaults, the variation in exposure magnitude results in a loss distribution that is not Poisson in general. Moreover, information about the distribution of different exposures is essential to the overall distribution. However, it is possible to describe the overall distribution of losses because its probability generating function has a simple closed form amenable to computation. 18 CREDIT FIRST SUISSE BOSTON Including default rate volatility Excluding default rate volatility Figure 6: CREDITRISK+ Model - Distribution of default events Probability Number of defaults CREDITRISK + 19 In the event of a default of an obligor, a firm generally incurs a loss equal to the amount owed by the obligor less a recovery amount, which the firm obtains as a result of foreclosure, liquidation or restructuring of the defaulted obligor. A recovery rate is used to quantify the amount received from this process. Recovery rates should take account of the seniority of the obligation and any collateral or security held. In order to reduce the amount of data to be processed, two steps are first followed: • The exposures are adjusted by anticipated recovery rates in order to calculate the loss in a given default. • The exposures, net of the above recovery adjustment, are divided into bands of exposure with the level of exposure in each band being approximated by a common average. The CREDITRISK+ Model calculates the probability that a loss of a certain multiple of the chosen unit of exposure will occur. This allows a full loss distribution to be generated, as shown in the figure below. 3.3.2 Impact of Incorporating Default Rate Volatilities Figure 7 compares the default loss distributions calculated without default rate volatility and with default rate volatility. The key features and differences are: • Same expected loss: Both default loss distributions have the same level of expected losses. • Fatter tail: The key change is the level of losses at the higher percentiles; for example, the 99th percentile is significantly higher when the impact of the variability of default rates is modelled. There is now considerably more chance of experiencing extreme losses. Since the tail of the distribution has become fatter, while the expected loss has remained unchanged, it can be concluded that the variance of the default loss distribution has increased. This increase in the variance is due to the pairwise default correlations between obligors. These pairwise default correlations are incorporated into the CREDITRISK+ Model through the default rate volatilities and sector analysis. It should be noted that when the default rate volatilities are set to zero, the default events are independent and hence the pairwise default correlations are also zero. In Appendix A, we give an explicit formula for the pairwise default correlations implied by the CREDITRISK+ Model when default rate volatilities are incorporated into the model. 3 CREDITRISK+ Model Excluding default rate volatility Including default rate volatility Figure 7: CREDITRISK+ Model - Distribution of default losses The CREDITRISK+ Model allows explicit calculation of the loss distribution of a portfolio of credit exposures. Size of loss Probability 3.4 Concentration Risk and Sector Analysis The CREDITRISK+ Model measures the benefit of portfolio diversification and the impact of concentrations through the use of sector analysis. 3.4.1 Concentration Risk Diversification arises naturally because the number of individual risks in a portfolio of exposures is usually large. However, even in a portfolio containing a large number of exposures, there may be an opposing effect owing to concentration risk. Concentration risk results from having in the portfolio a number of obligors whose fortunes are affected by a common factor. In order to quantify concentration risk, the concepts of systematic factors and specific factors are necessary. Systematic factors Systematic factors are background factors that affect the fortunes of a proportion of the obligors in the portfolio, for example all those obligors having their domicile in a particular country. The fortunes of any one obligor can be affected by a number of systematic factors. Specific factors In general, the fortunes of an obligor are affected to some extent by specific factors unique to the obligor. Systematic factors impact the risk of extreme losses from a portfolio of credit exposures, while diversification largely eliminates the impact of the specific factors. Concentration risk is dependent on the systematic factors affecting the portfolio. The technique for measuring concentration risk is sector analysis. 3.4.2 Sector Analysis - Allocating all Obligors to a Single Sector The most straightforward application of the CREDITRISK+ Model is to allocate all obligors to a single sector. This approach assumes that a single systematic factor affects the individual default rate volatility of each obligor. Furthermore, this use of the model captures all of the concentration risk within the portfolio and excludes the diversification benefit of the fortunes of individual obligors being subject to a number of independent systematic factors. Therefore, the most straightforward application of the CREDITRISK+ Model, in which all obligors are allocated to a single sector, generates a prudent estimate of extreme losses. 3.4.3 Sector Analysis - Allocating Obligors to one of Several Sectors In order to recognise some of the diversification benefit of obligors whose fortunes are affected by a number of independent systematic factors, it can be assumed that each obligor is subject to only one systematic factor, which is responsible for all of the uncertainty of the obligor’s default rate. For example, obligors could be allocated to sectors according to their country of domicile. Once allocated to a sector, the obligor’s default rate and default rate volatility are set individually. In this case, a sector can be thought of as a collection of obligors having the common property that they are influenced by the same single systematic factor. 3.4.4 Sector Analysis - Apportioning Obligors across Several Sectors A more generalised approach is to assume that the fortunes of an obligor are affected by a number of systematic factors. The CREDITRISK+ Model handles this situation by apportioning an obligor across several sectors rather than allocating an obligor to a single sector. 20 CREDIT FIRST SUISSE BOSTON Concentration risk is dependent on the systematic factors affecting the portfolio. The technique for measuring concentration risk is sector analysis. So far it has been assumed that all risk in the portfolio is systematic and allocable to one of the systematic factors. In addition to the effects of systematic factors, it is likely that the fortunes of an obligor are affected by factors specific to the obligor. Potentially specific risk requires an additional sector to model each obligor, since the factor driving specific risk for a given obligor affects that obligor only. However, the CREDITRISK+ Model handles specific risk without recourse to a large number of sectors by apportioning all obligors’ specific risk to a single “Specific Risk Sector”. 3.4.5 The Impact of Sectors on the Loss Distribution As stated above, the CREDITRISK+ Model allows the portfolio of exposures to be allocated to sectors to reflect the degree of diversification and concentration present. The most diversified portfolio is obtained when each exposure is in its own sector and the most concentrated is obtained when the portfolio consists of a single sector. The figure below shows the impact of sectors on the loss distribution. As the number of sectors is increased, the impact of concentration risk is reduced. The graph illustrates this by plotting the ratio of the 99th percentile of the credit default loss distribution for a given number of sectors to the 99th percentile of the credit default loss distribution when the portfolio is considered to be a single sector. 3.5 Multi-Year Losses for a Hold-to-Maturity Time Horizon As discussed in Section 2.5, the CREDITRISK+ Model allows risk of the portfolio to be viewed on a hold-tomaturity time horizon in order to capture any default losses that could occur until maturity of the credit exposure. Analysing credit exposures on a multi-year basis enables the risk manager to compare exposures of different size, credit quality, and maturity. The loss distribution produced provides, for any chosen level of confidence, an indication of the possible cumulative losses that could be suffered until all the exposures have matured. The benefits of looking at portfolio credit risk from this viewpoint include the following: • The full term structure of default probabilities is taken into account. • The full uncertainty of default losses over the life of the portfolio is also captured. For example, because the one-year average default rates for investment grade obligors are relatively small but the corresponding exposures may be large, a one-year time horizon may not be the best measure for active portfolio management. However, a multi-year view will reflect the fact that defaults follow a decline in credit quality over many years. CREDITRISK + 21 3 CREDITRISK+ Model The CREDITRISK+ Model allows the portfolio of exposures to be decomposed into sectors to reflect the degree of diversification and concentration present. Figure 8: Impact of sectors on the loss distribution The CREDITRISK+ Model allows the risk of the portfolio to be viewed on a hold-tomaturity time horizon in order to capture any default losses that could occur until maturity of the credit exposure. Number of sectors 99th percentile ratio 0.50 0.55 0.60 0.65 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00 0123456789 3.5.1 Using the CREDITRISK+ Model to Calculate Multi-Year Loss Distributions The CREDITRISK+ Model can be used to calculate multi-year loss distributions by decomposing the exposure profile over time into separate elements of discrete time, with the present value of the remaining exposure in each time period being assigned a marginal default probability relevant to the maturity and credit quality. These decomposed exposure elements can then be used by the CREDITRISK+ Model to generate a loss distribution on a hold-to-maturity basis. 3.6 Summary of the CREDITRISK+ Model The key features of the CREDITRISK+ Model are: • The CREDIT RISK+ Model captures the essential characteristics of credit default events. Credit default events are rare and occur in a random manner with observed default rates varying significantly from year to year. The approach adopted reflects these characteristics by making no assumptions about the timing or causes of default events and by incorporating the default rate volatility. By taking a portfolio approach, the benefits of diversification that arise from a large number of individual risks are fully captured. Concentration risk, resulting from groups of obligors that are affected by common factors, is measured using sector analysis. • The CREDIT RISK+ Model is scaleable and computationally efficient. The CREDITRISK+ Model is highly scaleable and hence is capable of handling portfolios containing large numbers of exposures. The low data requirements and minimum of assumptions make the CREDITRISK+ Model easy to implement for a wide range of credit risk portfolios, regardless of the specific nature of the obligors. Furthermore, the efficiency of the model allows comprehensive sensitivity analysis to be performed on a continuing basis, which is a key requirement for the ability to quantify the effects of parameter uncertainty. 22 CREDIT FIRST SUISSE BOSTON E C CREDITRISK + 23 4.1 Introduction to Economic Capital 4.1.1 The Role of Economic Capital The analysis of uncertainty is the essence of risk management. Therefore, measuring the uncertainty or variability of loss and the related likelihood of the possible levels of unexpected losses in a portfolio of exposures is fundamental to the effective management of credit risk. Sufficient earnings should be generated through adequate pricing and provisioning to absorb any expected loss. The expected loss is one of the costs of transacting business which gives rise to credit risk. However, economic capital is required as a cushion for a firm’s risk of unexpected credit default losses, because the actual level of credit losses suffered in any one period could be significantly higher than the expected level. 4.2 Economic Capital for Credit Risk 4.2.1 Credit Default Loss Distribution Knowledge of the credit default loss distribution arising from a portfolio of exposures provides a firm with management information on the amount of capital that the firm is putting at risk by holding the credit portfolio. Given that economic capital is necessary as a cushion for a firm’s risk of unexpected credit default losses, a percentile level provides a means of determining the level of economic capital for a required level of confidence. In order to capture a significant proportion of the tail of the credit default loss distribution, the 99th percentile unexpected loss level over a one-year time horizon is a suitable definition for credit risk economic capital. This can be seen in the following figure. Econo Capita Economic Capital for Credit Risk 4 Economic Capital Credit Default Loss Distribution Scenario Analysis 4.2.2 Benefits and Features of Economic Capital Economic capital as a measure of risk being taken by a firm has several features and benefits including the following: • It is a more appropriate measure of the economic risk than that specified under the current regulatory regime. • It measures economic risk on a portfolio basis and hence takes account of the benefits of diversification. • It is a measure that objectively differentiates between portfolios by taking account of credit quality and size of exposure. • It is a dynamic measure, which reflects the changing risk of a portfolio and hence can be used as a tool for portfolio optimisation. 4.3 Scenario Analysis 4.3.1 The Role of Scenario Analysis The purpose of scenario analysis is to identify the financial impact of low probability but nevertheless plausible events that may not be captured by a statistically based model. Therefore, the use of a credit risk model should be supplemented by a programme of stress testing of the assumptions used. There are two types of stress tests that should be performed: (i) scenario analysis within the CREDITRISK+ Model, and (ii) scenario analysis outside the CREDITRISK+ Model. 4.3.2 Scenario Analysis within the CREDITRISK+ Model The inputs into the CREDITRISK+ Model can be stressed individually or in combination. For example, it is possible to simulate downturns in the economy by increasing default rates and default rate volatilities - sectors of the portfolio can be stressed to varying degrees reflecting the fact that each sector could be affected to a different extent. Similarly, the financial impact of rating downgrades can be assessed by increasing the default rate assigned to an obligor. For a derivatives portfolio, this can be extended to include the effects of movements in market rates on credit exposures. Given the efficient manner in which the default loss distribution can be calculated, it is possible to calculate the impact of changing parameter inputs used by the model across a wide range of values. 24 CREDIT FIRST SUISSE BOSTON Expected Loss 99th Percentile Loss Level Economic Capital Figure 9: Economic capital for credit risk Loss Probability Economic Capital Credit Default Loss Distribution Scenario Analysis 4.3.3 Scenario Analysis outside the CREDITRISK+ Model Certain stress tests can be difficult to perform within the CREDITRISK+ Model: for example, the impact of political or financial uncertainty within a country. For these types of scenarios, analysis that is conducted without reference to the outputs of the CREDITRISK+ Model, such as looking at the exposure at risk for a given scenario, provides a realistic means of quantifying the financial impact. A firm should control the risk of catastrophic losses through the use of obligor and concentration limits, keeping any one of these limits within the loss for the percentile level used to determine the economic capital given by the CREDITRISK+ Model. The figure below illustrates the way in which the distribution of losses can be considered to be divided into three parts. It is possible to control the risk of losses that fall within each of the three parts of the loss distribution in the following ways: Part of loss distribution Control mechanism Up to Expected Loss Adequate pricing and provisioning Expected Loss - 99th Percentile Loss Economic capital and/or provisioning Greater than 99th Percentile Loss Quantified using scenario analysis and controlled with concentration limits Scenario analysis deals with quantifying and controlling the risk of extreme losses. Losses up to a certain confidence level, such as the 99th percentile level, are controlled by the use of adequate pricing, provisioning and economic capital. Provisioning for credit risk is discussed in detail in Section 5.2. CREDITRISK + 25 4 Economic Capital Scenario analysis provides a means of quantifying catastrophic losses - potential losses can be controlled through concentration limits.

Usually, credit loss provisions are made only when exposures have been identified as non-performing. These provisions are often supplemented with other specific and general credit provisions. In relation to any portfolio of credit exposures, there is a statistical likelihood that credit default losses will occur, even though the obligors are currently performing and it is not possible to identify specifically which obligors will default. The level of expected loss reflects the continuing credit risk associated with the firm’s existing performing portfolio and is one of the costs of doing credit-related business. This level of expected loss should be taken account of when executing any business that has a credit risk impact. When default losses are modelled, it can be observed that the most frequent loss amount will be much lower than the average, because, occasionally, extremely large losses are suffered, which have the effect of increasing the average loss. Therefore, a credit provision is required as a means of protecting against distributing excess profits earned during the below average loss years. 26 CREDIT FIRST SUISSE BOSTON Applications of CREDITRISK+ 5 The CREDITRISK+ credit risk provisioning methodology more accurately reflects the true earnings of the business by matching income with losses. Applications Provisioning Limits Portfolio Management c T CREDITRISK + 27 5 Applications The Annual Credit Provision reflects the continuing credit risk associated with the portfolio and is one of the costs of doing business that creates credit risk. Figure 11: Credit risk provisioning The Incremental Credit Reserve protects against unexpected credit losses and is used to absorb losses that are higher than the expected level. 5.2.2 Annual Credit Provision (ACP) The starting point for provisioning is to separate the existing portfolio into a non-performing and a performing portfolio. The non-performing portfolio should be fully provisioned to the expected recovery level available through foreclosure, administration or liquidation. Once fully provisioned, the non-performing portfolio should then be separated out and passed to a specialist team for ongoing management. As for the performing portfolio, since no default has occurred, one needs a forward-looking provisioning methodology. Under CREDITRISK+, the Annual Credit Provision (“ACP”) represents the future expected credit loss on the performing portfolio, which is calculated as follows: ACP = Exposure x Default Rate x (100% - Recover Rate) The ACP should be calculated frequently in order to reflect the changing credit quality of the portfolio. The ACP is the first element of the credit provisioning methodology. 5.2.3 Incremental Credit Reserve (ICR) The ACP represents only the expected or average level of credit losses. As experience shows, actual losses that occur in any one year may be higher or lower than this amount, depending on the economic environment, interest rates, etc. In fact, a better way of viewing the annual credit loss of the portfolio is as a distribution of possible losses (outcomes), whose average equals the ACP but has a small probability of much larger losses. In order to absorb these variations in credit losses from year to year, a second element of the provisioning methodology, the Incremental Credit Reserve (“ICR”), can be established. The CREDITRISK+ Model provides information on the distribution of possible losses in the performing credit portfolio. The ICR provides protection against unexpected credit losses (i.e. in excess of the ACP) and is subject to a cap derived from the CREDITRISK+ Model (the “ICR Cap”). The ICR Cap represents an extreme case of possible credit losses (e.g. the 99th percentile loss level) on the performing portfolio. ACP=Average level of credit losses ICR Cap =99th Percentile Loss Level Typical ICR Loss Probability 5.2.4 Provisioning for Different Business Lines The credit risk provisioning methodology described above relates to credit risk arising from a loans business where the income is accounted for on an accruals basis rather than by marking-to-market. A credit risk provision can also be established for other credit business lines, such as traded bond portfolios and derivatives portfolios. In each case, the CREDITRISK+ Model provides the information required in order to establish the provision that ensures that the accounting principle of matching income with losses is maintained. For example, for a portfolio of bonds, part of the expected loss is incorporated within the market price and hence only the incremental credit reserve is required. This is described in the following table. Portfolio type Accounting treatment Provision Loan Accrual • ACP (1 year) charge to P&amp;L each year (Counterparty risk) (credit neutral) • ICR (1 year) Derivatives Mark-to-market • ACP (full maturity) held as mark-to-market adjustment (Counterparty risk) (credit neutral) • ICR (1 year) Bond Mark-to-market • ICR (1 year) to support business and protect against (Issuer risk) (credit inclusive) distribution of profits 5.2.5 Managing the Credit Risk Provision As credit defaults occur, loans or exposures are moved from the performing to the non-performing portfolio and hence provisioned to the expected recovery level. This increase in provision is then charged first against the ACP and then, to the extent necessary, against the ICR. To the extent that actual credit losses are less than the ACP within any given year, the balance is credited to the ICR up to the ICR Cap, beyond which the balance is taken into P&amp;L. This ensures that the ICR is replenished during low loss years following a large unexpected loss, but that the ICR never exceeds the ICR Cap. A worked example can be seen in the table below: Year 1 2 3 4 5 Assumptions Actual loan losses 500 600 300 300 650 ACP 500 525 550 610 625 ICR - Initial level 1,900 - - - - ICR Cap 2,000 2,100 2,200 2,250 2,300 Income Statement Operating profit 2,100 2,100 2,205 2,315 2,430 Less: ACP (500) (525) (550) (610) (625) Add: excess unutilised provision over ICR Cap 0 0 0 135 0 Pre-tax profit 1,600 1,575 1,655 1,840 1,805 ICR (pre cap) 1,900 1,825 2,075 2,385 2,225 ICR Cap (as above) 2,000 2,100 2,200 2,250 2,300 Excess unutilised provision over ICR Cap 0 0 0 135 0 ICR (with cap applied) 1,900 1,825 2,075 2,250 2,225 28 CREDIT FIRST SUISSE BOSTON Table 6: Provisioning for different business lines Table 7: Example of credit risk provisioning CREDITRISK + 29 5.3 Risk-Based Credit Limits A system of individual credit limits is a well-established means of managing credit risk. Monitoring exposures against limits provides a trigger mechanism for identifying potentially unwanted exposures that require active management. 5.3.1 Standard Credit Limits The system of credit limits may be viewed from a different perspective, if applying the methodologies described within this document. In particular, in order to equalise a firm’s risk appetite between obligors as a means of diversifying its portfolio, a credit limit system could aim to have a large number of exposures with equal expected losses. The expected loss for each obligor can be calculated as the default rate multiplied by the exposure amount less the expected recovery. This means that individual credit limits should be set at levels that are inversely proportional to the default rate corresponding to the obligor rating. As might be expected, this methodology gives larger limits for better ratings and shorter maturities, but has the benefit of allowing a firm to relate the size and tenor of limits for different rating categories to each other. This approach can be extended to base limits on equalising the portfolio risk contribution for each obligor. A discussion on risk contributions and their use in portfolio management is provided later in this section. 5.3.2 Concentration Limits Any excess country or industry sector concentration can have a negative effect on portfolio diversification and increase the riskiness of the portfolio. As a result, a comprehensive set of country and industry sector limits is required to address concentration issues in the portfolio. Concentration limits have the effect of limiting the loss from identified scenarios and is a powerful technique for managing “tail” risk and controlling catastrophic losses. 5.4 Portfolio Management The CREDITRISK+ Model makes the process of controlling and managing credit risk more objective by incorporating into a single measure all of the factors that determine the amount of risk. 5.4.1 Introduction Currently, the primary technique for controlling credit risk is through the use of limit systems, including: • Individual obligor limits to control the size of exposure • Tenor limits to control the maximum maturity of transactions with obligors • Rating exposure limits to control the amount of exposure to obligors of certain credit ratings and • Concentration limits to control concentrations within countries and industry sectors. 5 Applications A system of standard credit limits can be supplemented with portfolio level risk information to manage credit risk. Applications Provisioning Limits Portfolio Management 5.4.2 Identifying Risky Exposures The risk of a particular exposure is determined by four factors: (i) the size of exposure, (ii) the maturity of the exposure, (iii) the probability of default, and (iv) the systematic or concentration risk of the obligor. Credit limits aim to control risk arising from each of these factors individual The reduction in the 99th percentile loss level is larger than the reduction in the expected loss level, which leads to an overall reduction in the economic capital required to support the portfolio. 5.4.5 Techniques for Distributing Credit Risk Once obligors representing a significant proportion of the risk have been identified, there are several techniques for distributing credit risk that can be applied. These include the following: • Collateralisation: In the context of the CREDITRISK+ Model, taking collateral has the effect of reducing the severity of the loss given that the obligor has defaulted. • Asset securitisations: Asset securitisations involve the packaging of assets into a bond, which is then sold to investors. • Credit derivatives: Credit derivatives are a means of transferring credit risk from one obligor to another, while allowing client relationships to be maintained.</p>
